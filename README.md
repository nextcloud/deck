## Installation/Update

This app is supposed to work on the two latest Nextcloud versions.

### Install latest release

You can download and install the latest release from the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck)

### Install from git

If you want to run the latest development version from git source, you need to clone the repo to your apps folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/deck.git
cd deck
make install-deps
make build
```

Please make sure you have installed the following dependencies: `make, which, tar, npm, curl, composer`

### Install the nightly builds

Instead of setting everything up manually, you can just [download the nightly build](https://github.com/nextcloud/deck/releases/tag/nightly) instead. These builds are updated every 24 hours, and are pre-configured with all the needed dependencies.

## Developing

### PHP

Nothing to prepare, just dig into the code.

### JavaScript

Deck requires running a `make build-js` to install npm dependencies and build the JavaScript code using webpack. While developing you can also use `make watch` to rebuild everytime the code changes.

#### Hot reloading

Enable debug mode in your config.php `'debug' => true,`

Without SSL:
```
npx webpack-dev-server --config webpack.hot.js \
    --public localhost:3000 \
    --output-public-path 'http://localhost:3000/js/'
```

With SSL:
```
npx webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --https \
    --cert ~/repos/nextcloud/nc-dev/data/ssl/nextcloud.local.crt \
    --key ~/repos/nextcloud/nc-dev/data/ssl/nextcloud.local.key \
    --public nextcloud.local:3000 \
    --output-public-path 'https://nextcloud.local:3000/js/'
```

### Running tests
You can use the provided Makefile to run all tests by using:

    make test

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
