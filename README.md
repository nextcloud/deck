## Installation/Update

This app is supposed to work on Nextcloud version 11 or later.

### Install latest release

You can download and install the latest release from the [Nextcloud app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/deck)

### Install from git

If you want to run the latest development version from git source, you need to clone the repo to your apps folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/deck.git
cd deck
make install-deps
make
```

Please make sure you have installed the following dependencies: `make, which, tar, npm, curl`

### Install the nightly builds

Instead of setting everything up manually, you can just [download the nightly builds](https://download.bitgrid.net/nextcloud/deck/nightly/) instead. These builds are updated every 24 hours, and are pre-configured with all the needed dependencies.

## Developing

### PHP

Nothing to prepare, just dig into the code.

### JavaScript

When `'debug'=>true` is set in your config.php files will get loaded automatically. Otherwise you need to ensure that `public/app.js` is generated by running `make` or `make watch` to regenerate it on every change.
Make sure you have installed the dependencies with ```make install-deps```.

### Running tests
You can use the provided Makefile to run all tests by using:

    make test

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
