### Mobile apps

- [Nextcloud Deck app for Android](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-deck) - It is available in [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/it.niedermann.nextcloud.deck/) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.niedermann.nextcloud.deck.play)
- [deck NG for Android and iOS](https://github.com/meltzow/deck-ng) - It is available in [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.meltzow.deckng) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deck-ng/id6443334702)

### 3rd-Party Integrations

- [mail2deck](https://github.com/newroco/mail2deck) - Provides an "email in" solution
- [A-deck](https://github.com/leoossa/A-deck) - Chrome Extension that allows to create new card in selected stack based on current tab
- [QOwnNotes](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes) - Quickly creates cards and links to them in Markdown notes

## Installation/Update

The app can be installed through the app store within Nextcloud. You can also download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/nextcloud-releases/deck/releases).

## Performance limitations

Deck is not yet ready for intensive usage.
A lot of database queries are generated when the number of boards, cards and attachments is high.
For example, a user having access to 13 boards, with each board having on average 100 cards,
and each card having on average 5 attachments,
would generate 6500 database queries when doing the file related queries
which would increase the page loading time significantly.

Improvements on Nextcloud server and Deck itself will improve the situation.

## Developing

There are multiple ways to develop on Deck. As you will need a Nextcloud server running, the individual options are described below.

### General build instructions

General build instructions for the app itself are the same for all options.

To build you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.

- Install PHP dependencies: `composer install --no-dev`
- Install JS dependencies: `npm ci`
- Build JavaScript for the frontend
    - Development build `npm run dev`
    - Watch for changes `npm run watch`
    - Production build `npm run build`

### Faster frontend developing with HMR

You can enable HMR (Hot module replacement) to avoid page reloads when working on the frontend:

1. ‚òëÔ∏è Install and enable [`hmr_enabler` app](https://github.com/nextcloud/hmr_enabler)
2. üèÅ Run `npm run serve`
3. üåç Open the normal Nextcloud server URL (not the URL given by above command)

### GitHub Codespaces / VS Code devcontainer

- Open code spaces or the repository in VS Code to start the dev container
- The container will automatically install all dependencies and build the app
- Nextcloud will be installed from the master development branch and be available on a port exposed by the container

### Docker: Simple app development container

- Fork the app
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/deck.git`
- Go into deck directory: `cd deck`
- Build the app as described in the general build instructions
- Run Nextcloud development container and mount the apps source code into it

```
docker run --rm \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -v ~/path/to/app:/var/www/html/apps-extra/app \
    ghcr.io/juliushaertl/nextcloud-dev-php80:latest
```

### Full Nextcloud development environment

You need to setup a [development environment](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual//getting_started/devenv.html) of the current Nextcloud version. You can also alternatively install & run the [nextcloud docker container](https://github.com/juliushaertl/nextcloud-docker-dev).
After the finished installation, you can clone the deck project directly in the `/[nextcloud-docker-dev-dir]/workspace/server/apps/` folder.

### Running tests
You can use the provided Makefile to run all tests by using:

    make test

## Contribution Guidelines

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://nextcloud.com/community/code-of-conduct/). This document offers some guidance to ensure Nextcloud participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strengthen and support each other.

### Apply a license

All contributions to this repository are considered to be licensed under
the GNU AGPLv3 or any later version.

Contributors to the Deck app retain their copyright. Therefore we recommend
to add following line to the header of a file, if you changed it substantially:

```
@copyright Copyright (c) <year>, <your name> (<your email address>)
```

For further information on how to add or update the license header correctly please have a look at [our licensing HowTo][applyalicense].

### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard
for the Nextcloud project. This is a well established and widely used
mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license
their contribution under the project's license.
Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin][dcofile].
If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

````
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
````

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases)
like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with
`git ci` and the commit will be signed.
